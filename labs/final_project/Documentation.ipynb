    "The bar charts above are incredibly revealing. For the steel beam, the \"Manufacturing\" stage is overwhelmingly dominant across all impact types. \n",
    "\n",
    "A closer look at the data shows that **approximately 71% of the steel beam's total carbon footprint originates from its manufacturing process.** This highlights that while transportation and end-of-life management have an impact, the most significant opportunity for environmental improvement lies in sourcing steel produced with cleaner energy or increasing the use of recycled content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This end-to-end analysis demonstrates how the tool can be used not only to compare products but also to pinpoint the specific \"hotspots\" within a product's life cycle that require the most attention for sustainability efforts."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully developed a modular and automated tool for performing Life Cycle Analysis. The tool provides a complete, end-to-end workflow, from data ingestion and validation to calculation and visualization, making LCA more accessible and efficient. The modular structure (`src`) and comprehensive test suite (`tests`) ensure that the tool is both reliable and easily extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis scenario presented in this document demonstrated the tool's practical value. By quantitatively comparing a steel beam and an engineered wood beam, we were able to validate the hypothesis that the wood beam has a significantly lower environmental footprint, particularly a carbon impact that is over five times smaller. Furthermore, the drill-down analysis successfully identified the manufacturing stage as the primary environmental \"hotspot\" for the steel beam, proving the tool's capability to guide targeted sustainability efforts. In conclusion, this project serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for data-driven decision-making in sustainable design.\n",

    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While this tool is fully functional, there are numerous opportunities for future expansion and improvement. Potential next steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanding the Database:**\n",
    "    * Incorporate a wider range of materials (e.g., composites, advanced polymers, different alloys).\n",
    "    * Integrate more comprehensive and region-specific impact factor databases (like Ecoinvent) to allow for more granular analysis based on geographical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Developing a User Interface:**\n",
    "    * Create a graphical user interface (GUI), potentially as a web application using frameworks like **Streamlit** or **Flask**. This would make the tool accessible to non-programmers, allowing them to upload their own data files and generate reports interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increasing Analysis Depth:**\n",
    "    * Add more LCA impact categories beyond carbon, water, and energy, such as **Acidification Potential (AP)**, **Eutrophication Potential (EP)**, and **Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)**.\n",
    "    * Implement uncertainty analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) to account for variability in input data and provide results as a range rather than a single point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API and Integration:**\n",
    "    * Develop a REST API to allow other software to programmatically access the LCA calculation engine.\n",
    "    * Explore potential integrations with architectural design software (e.g., Revit, ArchiCAD) to provide real-time environmental feedback during the design process."
