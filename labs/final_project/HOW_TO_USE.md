## üìñ Overview

Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is a methodology for assessing the environmental impacts of a product across its entire life span, from raw material extraction ("cradle") to its final disposal ("grave"). This tool automates the LCA process, enabling a direct and data-driven comparison of different materials' environmental performance. It calculates and visualizes key impact indicators to support engineers and architects in making more sustainable design decisions.

## ‚ú® Features

#### Data Management
* **Multi-format Support:** Ingests data from CSV, Excel, and JSON files.
* **Data Validation:** Ensures data integrity and completeness before processing.
* **Database Integration:** Utilizes a JSON-based database for environmental impact factors.

#### Impact Analysis
* **Core Metrics:** Calculates Carbon Footprint (kg CO2e), Energy Consumption (kWh), and Water Usage (Liters).
* **Waste Tracking:** Aggregates and tracks waste generated throughout the lifecycle.
* **End-of-Life:** Analyzes end-of-life scenarios, including recycling, landfill, and incineration rates.

#### Visualization
* **Impact Breakdowns:** Pie charts showing impact distribution by material or life cycle stage.
* **Lifecycle Hotspots:** Bar charts to identify the most impactful stages for a single product.
* **Product Comparison:** Radar charts for a head-to-head comparison of multiple products.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmaps to visualize the relationships between different impact categories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ilkercvkk/CE49X.git](https://github.com/ilkercvkk/CE49X.git)
cd CE49X/labs/final_project/
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The project is now ready to run.

## üöÄ How to Use

There are two main ways to use this project: running the automated script or verifying the code with tests.

#### 1. Run the Full Analysis
To execute the entire end-to-end analysis, run the main script from the project root directory. This will load the data, perform all calculations, and save the resulting data and figures into the `outputs/` directory.

```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

#### 2. Run the Tests
To verify that all modules are functioning correctly, you can run the test suite using `pytest`.

```bash
pytest
```
A successful run will show all tests passing.
